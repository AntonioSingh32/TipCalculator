## Notes

Only complications were during the function onTap because it repeatedly gave me the error "Editor placeholder in source code" whenever I added the bool view.endEditing. I finally fixed it by removing the force bool in parentheses and putting the value true in its place.

Rather than going with the preset percentages in the basic version of the calculator I wanted to give the users the ability to make their own percentages if need be or if they had their own preset tip percentages in mind.
